# TF2 MvM 10 Players

This plugin patches the server to allow 10 human players to join a MvM game.

Unfortunately, the signatures from the file *tf2mvm10plr.games.txt* must be updated every time the server.so/dll is updated(almost every update).

Last game data file updated on **11 September 2020**

Here is a video about how you can update the game data by yourself: https://github.com/gabriel-munteanu/SMPlugins.git
