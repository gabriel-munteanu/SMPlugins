# Collision Rush

This plugin allows servers with a lot of players and collision enabled to solve the rush problem by disabling the collision for a few moments and after that enable the push away effect.
Because sometimes the push away effect is not enough , there is a *sm_unstuck / sm_unblock* (!unstuck/!unblock) command so players get unstuck on their own.

## Cvars

*sm_cr_nocollision_time* - No collision time offset(after freeze time)

*sm_cr_pushaway_time* - Push away time
